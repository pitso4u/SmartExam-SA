This is a placeholder for gradle-wrapper.jar.

The actual gradle-wrapper.jar is a binary file that should be downloaded 
when you first sync the project in Android Studio.

To properly set up the Gradle wrapper:
1. Open the project in Android Studio
2. Android Studio will automatically download and set up the wrapper
3. Or run: gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.5

For now, just open the project in Android Studio and let it sync.
